#There are two players.
#Each player writes a number, hidden from the other player. It can be any integer 1 or greater.
#The players reveal their numbers.
#Whoever chose the lower number gets 1 point, unless the lower number is lower by only 1, then the player with the higher number gets 2 points.
#If they both chose the same number, neither player gets a point.
#This repeats, and the game ends when one player has 5 points.
